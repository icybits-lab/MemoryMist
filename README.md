This is a mess lol. So many files. This is my first big enough project.

# Notice
This is just a memory project for me now. I don't even wanna clean it up. Just look at that mess haha. I wrote every single page like an idiot. well, I was pretty inexperienced back then 🐥 I can fit that just in one file now.

But, I think I shouldn't clean the code. This was my first ever project. even though it's not pretty 🗿 It still is the project I worked on restlessly with a burning passion. This was my first project, the starting point.

I cannot erase that by editing these codes...(Also it proves I started programming quite some time ago. Works as a proof for my portfolio.)

I did still write less experience in my portfolio. To show there was a learning phase.
